# Automobile_Sales_Analysis_Excel

In this project, focused automobile market research analysis is performed, specifically targeting car manufacturers. I have employed descriptive analysis with the help of fundamental statistical techniques and basic data visualization techniques using MS Excel that effectively communicate key findings. I have enhanced the ability to unravel valuable insights in the context of car manufacturer market research by identifying the potential model and present insights about the most diverse car manufacturer in the given country.

A cleaned sample dataset with few important columns is attached for reference.

A dashboard to explore the analysis is attached for your viewing.

Thank you!
