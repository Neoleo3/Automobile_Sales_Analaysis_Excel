# Automobile Sales Analysis Excel

In this project, a focused automobile market research analysis is performed, specifically targeting car manufacturers.
### Problem Statement 
A car manufacturer is operating in a market where** customers** are **becoming more eco-freindly**, **focusing on fuel efficiency**,** safety and performance**.
An analysis on the car manufacturer and customer markets can lead to informed insights for our car manufacturer.
### Objective of the analysis 
Look for potential car models to be launched to satisfy the customer.
Insights about the most diverse car manufacturer in the country.

### Technology
Excel is used for all parts of analysis.

### Pre-processing
Imputations of rows with missing values.
Replacing with mean values for NaN values in the dataset.

### Analysis
### Car manufacturers and City Mileages Offered in the market -

### Observtions
Suzuki leads significantly in city mileage compared to other manufacturers, suggesting it might prioritize fuel efficiency in city driving conditions.
Hyundai and Mahindra also perform well in city mileage, following Suzuki, which indicates these brands focus on balanced mileage offerings.

Ford and Skoda have the lowest city mileage, possibly indicating that their models prioritize other features over fuel efficiency in urban settings.

### Relationship btw displacement & mileage

### Observations
Negative correlation: Higher displacement leads to lower mileage
High variability: Mileage varies widely for displacements below 2000 cc.

### Frequency in City mileages
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d85cf0-9aee-4c66-ad76-80cf71b0e05c)
### Observations
The majority of city mileages fall within a specific range : 14.56 to 16.32. It shows a clear peak in the frequency of city mileages.
The frequency of city mileages decreases as the mileage values increase or decrease from the most frequent range.

### Engine displacements in the market
### Observations
Most Displacements are in the 1053-2032 Range: This group has the highest frequency.
Displacements Decrease Quickly in Higher Ranges: The frequency drops significantly in higher displacement groups.

### Manufacturers with widest range of car variants & their body types

### Observations
Suzuki dominates Hatchbacks: Suzuki offers significantly more hatchback variants than Hyundai.
Hyundai leads in Sedans and SUVs: Hyundai has a wider range of sedan and SUV options compared to Suzuki.

### City mileages and Fuel Tank Capacities

### Observations
Positive correlation: Vehicles with higher fuel efficiency generally have larger fuel tank capacities.

Outliers: A few highly efficient vehicles (near 90 km/l) have moderate tank capacities, deviating from the trend.

### Manufacturers & their Fuel tank efficiency

### Observtions
BMW leads in fuel efficiency:Among the manufacturers, BMW achieves the highest average distance driven in kilometers (fuel efficiency), as reflected by its significantly longer bar compared to the others.Suzuki has the lowest efficiency:Suzuki has the shortest bar, indicating it achieves the least average distance driven in kilometers per unit of fuel, making it the least efficient among the manufacturers shown.

### Summary
#### Fuel Efficiency and Displacement Trade-off: 
The plot in the first image shows a negative correlation between displacement and mileage, suggesting that higher displacement engines generally result in lower fuel efficiency. However, there's variability, indicating other factors are influential.

#### Suzuki's Dominance in Hatchbacks:
Suzuki offers 96 hatchback variants compared to Hyundai's 46 (from the first image), demonstrating a strong focus on this segment.


#### Hyundai's Leadership in Sedans and SUVs: 
Hyundai leads with 44 sedan variants and 35 SUV variants, compared to Suzuki's 31 and 11 respectively (from the first image), suggesting a broader market appeal


#### Suzuki's City Mileage Leadership: 
Suzuki's vehicles have the highest total city mileage (from the first image), indicating a focus on fuel-efficient technologies optimized for urban driving.


#### BMW's Focus on Range: 
BMW vehicles have the highest average fuel tank capacity of 60 liters (from the second image), suggesting a focus on long-distance driving or markets with less accessible refueling.


#### Tank Capacity and Fuel Economy Trade-off:
The scatter plot in the second image shows that larger fuel tanks tend to be associated with lower city mileage, supporting the observation that increased range may come at the expense of fuel efficiency in urban environments.
